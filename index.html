      <p>
        Utah is a somewhat decent state that has been on the downhill recently.
        Still if you don't mind driving a little bit for beautiful nature
        scenery Utah is a great place to live. If you don't mind the bad drivers
        and the traffic and the obscene house prices. The best place to live in
        Utah would be in the Cache Valley area for now.
